## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `ekthesis check` takes the root of the paths of a SARIF log from `-r`, `--root`, then from `EKTHESIS_ROOT`, then from the working directory, by the command-line conventions of the workspace.
- `ekthesis check` accepts the short form `-o` of `--output`, and writes the text lines to that file as well as the SARIF log.

### Fixed

- `ekthesis -v` and `ekthesis --version` print the version, where they ended with the error of a missing command.
